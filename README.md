# Project Overview
The primary objective of this system is to simplify and enhance the
efficiency of the process involved in searching for and selecting rooms, ensuring
a more seamless experience while minimizing the likelihood of errors in choosing
suitable accommodations. Additionally, the system offers comprehensive and
detailed information about each room, effectively eliminating the need for
potential tenants to directly reach out to property owners for specific details
regarding their accommodations, thereby saving time and reducing
communication hurdles.
# Sustainable Development Goal
My rental estate navigation and tracking system plays a role in supporting
small-scale landlords like me while making it easier for customers to find the
information they need about available rooms. By simplifying room management
and providing transparency, it helps small business owners, like myself, work
more efficiently, contributing to Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8). It
also introduces modern, tech-based solutions that make rental management
easier, aligning with Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9). 
Additionally, my system helps create Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) by
optimizing the use of resources and improving access to housing options. By
bridging gaps between landlords and renters, it also supports Reduced
Inequalities (SDG 10), making housing more accessible and fair for everyone. 
This isn’t just a practical tool for me it’s my way of contributing to a more inclusive
and efficient rental market.
